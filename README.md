# Food Order

## Overview
This project started as a UI/UX design in **Adobe XD**, where I carefully planned and designed the layout, components, and user interactions. After finalizing the design, I converted it into a functional web application using **React.js**.

## Features
- **Modern UI/UX**: Designed in Adobe XD with a focus on usability and aesthetics.
- **React Implementation**: Translated the design into a fully responsive React application.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The app is built using reusable React components for scalability and maintainability.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a seamless experience across different devices.
